i have developed this web template as my portfolio template.
You can imagine my experty level by looking at my work.
I have used simple HTML,CSS and a very little bit of javaScript.
This is a fully responsive web template.


there is only two files
1.index.html    -->the main file
2.style.css     -->the styling sheet file


Other then that we have a folder of images used in this web template.
